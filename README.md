## PDE course .tex and matlab files
Part of my engineering PDE class was to create .tex files to explain basic lectures and theory about PDE and matlab numerical methods on how to solve them.
This repository is disorganized at a certain extension but the .m and .tex codes are running properly.

### - This is one of my first .tex documents just to practice math notation.
